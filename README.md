# Google Docs Desktop OSX
A Super Simple Google Docs Desktop Client for Mac OSX Built in Javascript and MacGap

# Why
I love the Google suite but hate being limited to having to use their apps within my browser.  If you have many tabs, it's impractical for usability.

# What
It's one line of code to wrap Google Docs in an app window made possible by [MacGap](https://github.com/MacGapProject/MacGap2)

# Build
Build using instructions on [MacGap-rb](https://github.com/maccman/macgap-rb)

*Note: I'd recommend against using the binary releases at this point.  There have been issues with people downloading them and using them on different versions of OSX from what I've compiled them on and it causing problems.*

*That is, me compiling on whatever version of OSX I'm running can cause problems for you if you aren't running on the same version.  As I'm not sure what the future holds in terms of me or users of the app being up to date on the latest OSX, I'm just going to stop making releases for the foreseeable future and avoid issues.*

*Building from source following the directions in the instructions is the definite recommended method.*

# Run
